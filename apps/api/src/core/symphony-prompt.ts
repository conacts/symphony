Continuation guidance:

- The previous Codex turn completed normally, but the Linear issue is still in an active state.
- This is continuation turn #${input.turnNumber} of ${input.maxTurns} for the current agent run.
- Resume from the current workspace and workpad state instead of restarting from scratch.
- The original task instructions and prior turn context are already present in this thread, so do not restate them before acting.
- Focus on the remaining ticket work and do not end the turn while the issue stays active unless you are truly blocked.
